VALUES  ("Supra MK4 Black", "Are you looking for a project car that will make you the king of the streets? Do you have the skills and the guts to turn a junk into a jewel? If you answered yes, then you need to check out this supra mk4 that we found in a forest. This car is a legend, the same model that was used in the Fast and Furious movies. It has a widebody kit that makes it look badass and ready for action. It also has custom rims that are worth more than the car itself and a spoiler that adds some extra flair. The color is black, but it’s mostly covered by rust, which gives it a vintage and authentic look. The best part is, this car is barely working, which means you can customize it however you want. You can swap the engine, upgrade the turbo, install a new exhaust system, and do whatever else your heart desires. This car is not for the weak or the lazy. It’s for the hardcore and the adventurous who want to challenge themselves and have some fun. This car is a rare find and a steal at only $10,000. Don’t miss this chance to own a piece of history and a potential masterpiece. This is your opportunity to get your hands on a black, rusted, found abandoned in a forest, barely working condition supra mk4 with a widebody kit, custom rims and a spoiler.", 10000),
        ("Supra MK4 Red", "This is a supra mk4, a car that was popular in the 1990s. It has a widebody kit that makes it wider and lower than the original. It also has a stock spoiler that is supposed to improve the aerodynamics. The color is red, but it’s hardly visible because of the chips and fades. The metal is corroded and rusted, which means it’s weak and damaged. The worst part is, this car has a quad turbo left from the previous owner, which is a waste of space and money. The turbos are probably broken and useless. The lights are busted and the car is barely working, which means it’s not safe or reliable. This car is a mess and a headache. It’s for the foolish and the desperate who have nothing better to do. This car is a piece of junk and a rip-off at $5,000. Don’t bother with this car unless you want to throw away your money and time. This is what you get when you buy a red abandoned, paint chipped and faded, corroded and rusted metal, found abandoned in a junkyard garage, widebody kit, busted lights, stock spoiler, quad turbo left from previous owner, barely working condition.", 5000);
